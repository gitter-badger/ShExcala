# ShExcala

RDF Shape Expressions in Scala

This repository contains an RDF Shape Expressions validator implemented in Scala

## Compiling from sources

### Pre-requisites

ShExcala has been implemented in [Scala](scala-lang.org) and uses [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) to build. 

The only pre-requisite to build ShExcala is to have SBT installed (version 0.13.5 or bigger)

To compile and run tests

```
$ sbt test
```

To run from sbt

```
$ sbt run <parameters>
```

To create a standalone binary jar

```
$ sbt universal:packageBin
```

It will create a file shexcala-<version-number>.zip file located at: `target/universal/shexcala-<version>.zip` 

That file contains two excutable files for both Linux (`shexcala`) and Windows (`shexcala.bat`) which can be invoked from the command line.

## Usage

See [this link](https://github.com/labra/ShExcala/wiki) on how to use ShExcala from the command line.
