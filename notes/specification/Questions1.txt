Some notes on ShEx specification

- If actions are to be executed sequentially, then we should replace all Set's by sequences
- Is it really necessary the "id" label in ArcRule abstract syntax? 
- Should we have Set[RDFNode] in ValueSet instead of Set[IRI] so we could define, for example: 
    <a> { :p (1 2) }  ?
	
- Substitute Schema definition to Set[Shape] ?
